/**
 * *** Assignment: ***
 * Create a singlely linked list from an array of values.
 * 
 * A singlely linked list is a list of objects called 'nodes' that are, as the name suggests, linked together.
 * However, it is not an array. Each node object is only linked to one another through a 'next' property.
 * 
 * This means when you do 'node.next', you get the next node object in the list.
 * 
 * Each node object allows you to traverse forward in the list, but never backwards.
 * 
 * 
 * To run the test for this assignment, type and execute the following command in a terminal 'npm run test-linked-list'
 * 
 * *** Requirements: ***
 * 1. You must return the first node in the linked list from your createLinkedList function.
 * 2. Each node must contain a 'value' property that contains the value from the array.
 * 3. Each node must contain a 'next' property that contains the next node in the list.
